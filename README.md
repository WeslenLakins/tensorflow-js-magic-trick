## Project Overview

The TensorFlow.js Magic Trick project, titled "Disappearing People Project," showcases the power of TensorFlow.js and BodyPix model to remove people from complex backgrounds in real-time, using only JavaScript. This project demonstrates an innovative application of machine learning and computer vision directly in the browser, making it an exciting exploration for developers, hobbyists, and educators interested in real-time image processing, machine learning, and web development. Key features include real-time person removal from video streams and a demonstration of TensorFlow.js capabilities.

## Installation Instructions

This project requires no traditional installation or server setup, as it runs directly in the browser. To get started:

1. Download the project files from this repository.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that supports TensorFlow.js and the getUserMedia API for webcam access.

## Usage Guide

To use the application after setting it up, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Wait for the machine learning model to load. This process is automatic, and the demos will become visible and ready to use once the model is fully loaded.
3. To try the webcam live removal feature:
   - Ensure you have a webcam connected and permitted the web page to access it.
   - Click the "Enable Webcam" button.
   - Stand a few feet away from your webcam and start moving around to see yourself disappearing from the bottom preview in real-time.

The project also includes an embedded YouTube video demonstrating what you can expect from using the custom algorithm for real-time people removal.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is needed beyond what is provided within the project's code. The project uses predefined settings for the BodyPix model, which are optimized for this specific application. These settings include model architecture, output stride, multiplier, and quant bytes for efficient real-time performance on the web.
